        <br>4 stars I loved the buttery taste of the crust which complements the apples very nicely. -- Reviewed on Sep. 22, 2010 by MMASON.

        <br>Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling but there was too little of it. I thought the crunchy apples combined with the sliced almonds detracted from the overall flavor.

        <br>Delicious!! I recommend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking, to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for the holidays. -- Reviewed on August 28, 2010 by BBABS.
