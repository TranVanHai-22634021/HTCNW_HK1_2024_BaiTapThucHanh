        <span style="color:brown"> Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your
        wonderful performances.
        <br>
        <br> I've started putting up a <span style="color:blue"> <u><a href="../HTML/Slide1.html">slide show</a></u> </span> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD,
        please contact me.

        <br> Once again: <span style="color:brown"> <i>BRAVO!!!</i> </span> -- Mrs. Juroszek
